The files in this directory provide a parser as well as a compiler and 
interpreter for the EH scripting language. The parser provided here includes 
numerous features not supported by the PHP-based interpreter in 
ExecuteHandler.php, but is also missing some features (most notably PHP method 
calls in command form, but also the global keyword).

The following are some bugs and missing features still existing in the 
interpreter:
- Massive memory leakage. It's hard to keep track of all malloc'ed memory within
  the interpreter, but we can do better than the current situation.
- Missing the global keyword. This could be implemented using a new reference_e 
  type, with its value of type ehretval_t *. Any operation involving a 
  reference_e would manipulate its pointee instead. We'd introduce a new detach
  keyword to set a reference_e variable to null.
- Complete object-oriented support.
- Make the call keyword optional. This was not feasible in the PHP interpreter
  because of the way that was designed, but it should be possible to do so in 
  the parser by simply making an expression an acceptable statement.
- Enable execution from a command line. That is probably doable by having eh.y
  execute statements after calling operate on them if we're in scope 0.
- Parse EH.php-style commands into arrays. This would work similar to the PHP
  implementation, but would also use native EH expressions, so you can do stuff
  like this:
  > bfind --variables=[year: 2003, authors: '/Musser/'] --print=false
  The PHP implementation does not support parameters that are arrays.
- Integrate ehi into PHP using SWIG.

To compile the interpreter (ehi), write:
$ make interpreter

To use the compiler (ehc) instead, use:
$ make compiler

To compile and run a file called "compile.eh" with ehc:
$ ./meh.sh compile
$ ./compile
