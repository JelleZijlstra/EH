The files in this directory provide a parser as well as a compiler and 
interpreter for the EH scripting language. The parser provided here includes 
numerous features not supported by the PHP-based interpreter and supports virtually all features found in that implementation.

The following are some bugs and missing features still existing in the 
interpreter:
- Massive memory leakage. It's hard to keep track of all malloc'ed memory within
  the interpreter, but we can do better than the current situation.
- Foreach-like loops for objects and arrays.

To compile the interpreter (ehi), write:
$ make interpreter

To use the compiler (ehc) instead, write:
$ make compiler

To compile and run a file called "compile.eh" with ehc:
$ ./meh.sh compile
$ ./compile

Other things to do:
- Create a GeSHi spec for EH; see
