This repository contains an implementation of the EH programming language. I
created EH mostly for my own education, but also use it as a command language in
some of my other projects (e.g., the control system for my electronic library of
biological articles).

EH is an imperative, object-oriented, dynamic language. All values are objects,
and many operations are done through method calls. Functions are first-class
values. Virtually all symbols (including functions, classes, and other 
variables) are in the same namespace, but classes provide an easy way to 
namespace code.

The code was written and mostly run on a Mac OS X system, and some components
are running on Linux systems. However, I can't guarantee that this code will do
anything resembling what it is supposed to do on any systems other than my own;
use it at your own risk.

Dependencies:
- Flex
- Bison
- A C++ compiler (I've used g++ and clang++)
- For the ehphp portion: SWIG, PHP
