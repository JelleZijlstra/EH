This repository contains a number of tools for my personal use. Most are built
on or related to the ExecuteHandler PHP class, which provides a command-line
interface to PHP objects and the ability to have commands executed by the
object. The language used in these commands is called "eh" and has two
implementations, a pure PHP, but limited parser, and a full-featured parser
written in C++ using a yacc grammar.

This repository contains the following main folders:
- AvidaInterface: an interface to the Avida digital evolution engine. Used in an
  OEB 192 class project.
- Catalog: the program that keeps track of my database of scientific papers.
- Common: various things that are at the core of ExecuteHandler.
  ExecuteHandler.php contains the ExecuteHandler class and its core
  functionality, EHICore.php contains the pure-PHP implementation of eh,
  FileList.php and ListEntry.php contain the FileList and ListEntry classes,
  which are used in among others Catalog and List.
- doc: documentation for the eh language, currently incomplete.
- EH-parser: the C++ implementation of eh.
- EH-samples: samples of EH code, used to test the standalone C++ interpreter
  (ehi) for regressions. I hope to add support for testing of ehphp later.
- GeneralList: a program that can generate basic FileList and ListEntry
  implementations on the basis of a CSV input file.
- List: a program used to keep track of a list of the species of mammals. It
  uses FileList and ListEntry and is linked with Catalog.
- Misc: various utility scripts.
- MySQL: contains a Database class for a possible future move of
  FileList/ListEntry-type programs from CSV data files to proper MySQL
  databases.
- Parse: a program that can "parse" input for references defined in the Catalog
  and replace them with full citations.
- UcuchaBot: code used for bots that I run on Wikipedia.
