== PHP ==
All methods that execute user-visible commands should call process_paras before
executing any substantive code. (Some methods may need to execute a few 
assignments of local variables before calling process_paras.)

Braces should be used around any block of code, and braces should not be put on
their own lines, as follows:
	if($some_condition) {
		return true;
	} elseif($some_other_condition) {
		return false;
	} else {
		return true;
	}
This is not currently applied consistently.

Methods that execute commands should generally be declared public, because they
create a public interface that should in principle also be callable from other
classes. (Technically, such methods only need to be protected for the command to
work.)

Other methods and properties should have as low visibility as possible. Much
work is still needed to fix unnecessarily public class members.
