== PHP ==
All methods that execute user-visible commands should call process_paras before
executing any substantive code. (Some methods may need to execute a few 
assignments of local variables before calling process_paras.)

Braces should be used around any block of code, and braces should not be put on
their own lines, as follows:
	if($some_condition) {
		return true;
	} elseif($some_other_condition) {
		return false;
	} else {
		return true;
	}
This is not currently applied consistently.

Methods that execute commands should generally be declared public, because they
create a public interface that should in principle also be callable from other
classes. (Technically, such methods only need to be protected for the command to
work.)

Other methods and properties should have as low visibility as possible. Much
work is still needed to fix unnecessarily public class members.

== PHP version ==
I am running parts of this code on my own computer, which has PHP 5.4, as well 
as the Wikimedia Toolserver, which is still on PHP 5.3. Therefore, the portions 
of the code involved in the bot (EH core, Bot class, SqlContainer) should not 
use any new PHP 5.4 features. Other parts of the code should still not use new 
PHP 5.4 features that would cause parse errors in earlier versions (e.g., short 
array syntax), but may use other features that cause errors only at runtime 
(e.g., $this references in closures).
