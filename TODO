In the PHP code:
- Avoid loose comparison, create_function, private methods that are better
  recast as lambda functions, ad-hoc reimplementations of parts of menu() and
  process_paras().
- Minimize use of callmethodarg and all other execute variants except
  callmethod.

EH-PHP interface:
- Make the first parameter actually end up in paras[0], instead of the last one.
- Enable }$ and >$ use.

ehi core:
- Do something about those memory leaks.
