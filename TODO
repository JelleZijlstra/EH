In the PHP code:
- Avoid loose comparison, create_function, private methods that are better
  recast as lambda functions, ad-hoc reimplementations of parts of menu() and
  process_paras().

EH-PHP interface:
- Enable }$ and >$ use.
- The 'quit' command is broken when we're using nested interpreters (e.g., 
  'e "Agathaeromys nov.pdf"' in catalog. Perhaps fix this by making it throw
  an exception that gets caught at the top level of the interpreter in eh.y.

ehi core:
- Do something about those memory leaks.
- Make the math operators less happy to cast anything to an integer. `printvar: 
  1.0 / 3` should be (@float 0.3333), not (@int 0). In PHP even 1/3 becomes a 
  float, but I'd prefer to keep integer division, and I don't want to implement 
  the magic that enables them to have 4/2 === 2, but 5/2 === 2.5.
- Enable something like `arr->$primaryindex->$secondaryindex := 5`
