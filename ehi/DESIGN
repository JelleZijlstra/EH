OTHER THINGS TO DO
- Add something to ehobj_t so we can distinguish between classes and instances, and make static methods only callable in classes. Known bugs associated with not distinguishing between classes and instances well:
	- Float == 0.0 segfaults
	- List.prototype.propertyDoesNotExist segfaults
- Do something about the private-in-inherited-class bug.
