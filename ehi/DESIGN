THINGS TO DO
- Add something to ehobj_t so we can distinguish between classes and instances, and make static methods only callable in classes.
- Do something about the private-in-inherited-class bug.
- Fix the garbage collector, and get rid of reference counting altogether for ehval_w.
- Get rid of ehmember_p and instead store ehmember_t directly in the object.
- Get rid of object_data, since it no longer appears to be necessary.
