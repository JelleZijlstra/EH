OTHER THINGS TO DO
- Add something to ehobj_t so we can distinguish between classes and instances, and make static methods only callable in classes. Known bugs associated with not distinguishing between classes and instances well:
	- Float == 0.0 segfaults
	- List.prototype.propertyDoesNotExist segfaults
- Do something about the private-in-inherited-class bug.

REPLACING EHRETVAL_T
When we allocate a value, we do
ehval_p i = Integer::make(3);
or
ehval_p a = Array::make(new eharray_t, ehi);

ehval_p Integer::make(int in) {
	Integer *obj = new Integer(in);
}

USING C++11 FEATURES:
- type_index
