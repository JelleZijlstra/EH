OTHER THINGS TO DO
- Add something to ehobj_t so we can distinguish between classes and instances, and make static methods only callable in classes. Known bugs associated with not distinguishing between classes and instances well:
	- Float == 0.0 segfaults
	- List.prototype.propertyDoesNotExist segfaults
- Do something about the private-in-inherited-class bug.

RETHINKING ENUMS
Enum creates a real class with its own type_id. Enum overloads new() to throw an exception.

There is a separate Enum.Instance class holding:
- enum id of this enum member
- type id of the parent class
- array of parameters

Enum class holds information about each id - number of params.

Overloads operator() to create a new Enum.Instance object if params == null and type_id takes arguments.
